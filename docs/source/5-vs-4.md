RSS Guard 5 versus RSS Guard 4
==============================
Over the time of RSS Guard existence, it got many many features and got rather bloated. This is not quite what I as RSS Guard author had in mind when starting RSS Guard.

RSS Guard was meant to be simple feed reader with quite good speed while also provide next-gen features for power users like scriptable filtering.

Therefore new RSS Guard major version 5 returns the application to its core ideas. Many features found in version 4 are not present in version 5, like web browsing abilities, AdBlock, embedded file downloader and some other things. This makes codebase much slimmer and much more maintainable. RSS Guard 4 will now live in a separate [branch](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/tree/4.x) and **might** get some critical updates in the future.

```{attention}
As for data compatibility, version 5 is NOT fully compatible with version 4. Basically everything is compatible except for article filters, which were greatly updated and some variables were renamed. Other than that, you can simply take your user data and copy it into RSS Guard 5 and it will work. The opposite direction, using RSS Guard 5 data with RSS Guard 4, is **not possible**.
