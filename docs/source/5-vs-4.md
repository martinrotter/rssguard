RSS Guard 5 versus RSS Guard 4
==============================
Over the time of RSS Guard existence, it got many many features and got rather bloated. This is not quite what I as RSS Guard author had in mind when starting RSS Guard.

RSS Guard was meant to be simple feed reader with quite good speed while also provide next-gen features for power users like scriptable filtering.

Therefore new RSS Guard major version 5 returns the application to its core ideas. Many features found in version 4 are not present in version 5, like web browsing abilities, AdBlock, embedded file downloader and some other things. This makes codebase much slimmer and much more maintainable. RSS Guard 4 will now live in a separate [branch](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/tree/4.x) and **might** get some critical updates in the future.

```{attention}
As for data compatibility, version 5 is [NOT compatible](contrib/migrate) with version 4.
