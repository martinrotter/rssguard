Labels
======
RSS Guard supports labels (tags). Any number of tags can be assigned to any article.

Note that tags in some plugins are synchronizable. 

While labels are synchronized with these services, sometimes they cannot be directly created via RSS Guard. In this case, you have to create them via web interface of the respective service, and only after that perform `Synchronize folders & other items`, which will fetch newly created labels too.

New labels can be added via right-click menu of the `Labels` item in a feed list.

New label's title and color can also be chosen.

Unassigning a message label might easily be done through the message viewer.

Note that unassigning the message labels is also synchronized at regular intervals (with services that support label synchronization).

Message filters can also assign or remove labels from messages.
