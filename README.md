RSS Guard is also podcast player as it can play everything via its built-in `mpv`-based (or `ffmpeg`-based) media player.

Also, RSS Guard has built-in support for [Gemini](https://geminiprotocol.net) protocol and hypertext format, so it can very well act as reliable cross-platform Gemini client!
