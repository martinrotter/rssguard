5.0.0
-----
Released on: 2025-09-06

This is the first release of the brand-new 5.x RSS Guard line. Database files from the RSS Guard 4.x line is NOT compatible with this release because a massive overhaul of the database layer was performed. The database layer is now significantly more powerful, more maintainable, and in many cases, much faster.

Changes, improvements and fixes were done across the entire RSS Guard codebase with hundreds and hundreds of commits. Nearly every single source code file was touched. Almost 50 tickets were solved.

Many features which are not "typical" for RSS feed reader application were removed, including (but not limited to) QtWebEngine component, AdBlock and file downloader.

That said, many other features were added, including great enhancements for article filtering. See the full list of changes below.

Added:
* New built-in ability to fetch FULL articles for your feeds. It is switchable in feed details dialog and you can even set to fetch plain text only version of your full articles. The feature is also available as a function for your article filters so you can call this feature selectively depending on conditions etc. The functionality itself is coded in extra binary named `rssguard-article-scraper` which you can also use externally. This tools requires Go compiler for building. (#1783)
* QuiteRSS import was added. Right-click any account item in feed list and you will see it. It imports categories, feeds, articles and labels. (#1707)
* AppImages are back and better than before. They are available both in Qt 5 and Qt 6 versions. (#1808)
