4.6.3
-----

Dear users, there are new features which will be introduced in one of coming releases.

First of them is built-in HTTP API server which will provide basic REST-like interface for working with RSS Guard - getting list of articles, marking articles read or unread, etc. This will allow to use RSS Guard as a article server in local network.

In cooperation with the above feature, new "magazine view" will be implemented. This magazine view will be launchable even completely separately from RSS Guard in web browser and will be able to act as very simple web-based feed/article reader. It will fetch data directly from RSS Guard via its new web API and will display articles including their thumbnails in cool way. This feature will be also expanded in the future, based on user feedback.

Added:
* Lite internal web browser now properly decodes all HTML pages according to their declared encoding. (9c7f55094)
* Image downscaling in lite browser is faster. (8b91d4709)
* Icon for classic RSS/ATOM accounts is now changeable. (#695)
* If main window is active then "fetching started" notifications are not delivered. (#597)
* Number of child feed/categories is now shown for each category. (#1183)

Fixed:
* MPV libs were moved to separate Git submodule. (#1250)
* Applied workaround to fix PC not sleeping after sound is played. (#1118)
* Fixed problem with disappearing tabs.

4.6.2
-----

This release fixes couple of issues found after 4.6.0/4.6.1 releases.

Fixed:
* Fixed "Browse" button not working in "Media player" tab of settings dialog. (#1245)
* Was crashing on Linux. (#1244)

4.6.1
-----

Fixed:
* Fixed some compilation problems and related issues.

4.6.0
-----

This feature brings one major feature - podcast/media player. This media player is available when you open context menu for any hyperlink in article which you think leads to audio/video file. Simply right-mouse-click your link and select "Play in media player", then media player will open in next tab and start playing.

Full versions of RSS Guard (with QtWebEngine) include libmpv-based media player which can play basically every thinkable audio/video content. Windows build of RSS Guard even bundles yt-dlp binary to allow out-of-box support for Youtube playback.

Lite variants of RSS Guard include slightly lighter QtMultimedia/ffmpeg-based media player, which also can play many audio/video formats.

Qt5-based lite variants of RSS Guard will likely require you to install some system-wide codec pack.

https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/issues/1226

Added:
* Media/podcast player capabilities. See above for more information.
* Indication of which feed is actually fetching at the moment can be enabled in settings. (#1203)
* Newspaper view was removed as it was slow and very buggy. It might be replaced by something better in the future.
* Sections of settings now have icons.
* Docs updated.
* Layout of articles in default nudus-* skins was unified for full/lite versions. Formatting is now very similar.
* Image size/wrapping behavior was greatly improved in article viewer, particularly in lite version.

Fixed:
* Context menus in both full/lite article viewer are now more similar.
* Fixed crashing when editing e-mail via Gmail plugin. (76c7dd170)
* No more warning journal messages generated on Linux. (#1207)
* Updated and fixed some languages. (#1205)

4.5.5
-----

Added:
* Added feed manipulation for Google Reader API plugin - creating, editing, deleting feeds.

Fixed:
* Fixed yellow background in nowebengine version.
* No more double right mouse button click when closing notifications.

* Aux nodes "Important", "Probes", "Unread" and "Labels" now can be disabled per-account separately in account settings dialog. (#584)
* Toast notifications can be closed with right mouse button click.
* Google Reader API plugin now offers OPML import and export function. See context menu for it.

Fixed:

Added:
* Article and feed toolbar heights are now normalized to same values.

Fixed:
* Fixed couple of cases where feed multi-selection and/or batch operations were not taking multi-selection properly into account.
* Fixed some unnecessary prompts to restart app in settings dialog.
* Updated translations and readme.

4.5.2
-----

Dear users. Note that one of upcoming releases will break-backwards compatibility thus it will be labelled as "5.0.0". Backwards compatibility will be broken in several areas of the application - particularly I want to greatly enhance syntax/API of article filtering scripts, where I plan to restructure existing functions, make it all bit more clear and add some more functions.

Also, some other areas of RSS Guard might be touched so I will use the opportunity to make again some enhancements. I do not expect that DB incompatibility will be as high as it was when transitioning from 3.x to 4.x and I expect that existing RSS Guard databases will be converted to "5.x" format automatically.

Moreover, I thank to all users of this app. Currently according to my internal "guess" I believe that RSS Guard has 5000+ regular users and it is likely one of the most used RSS desktop cross-platform applications. I hope we will grow and I also send big thanks to all who donated some money. It is not much, but I have used some of it to buy parts for my home PC on which I develop RSS guard mostly. Thanks.

Btw, just thinking out loud. If each user contributed 5 USD per year, I could do RSS Guard development as my full-time job, which I would love to. :D

That's all I wanted to say. Thanks, users.

Added:
* Added new "Discover feeds" dialog which is automatically opened when user hits "Add new feed" button. In this dialog, use does not have to input exact feed address but can enter just regular website address and RSS Guard will try to discover all available feeds possible. (#1134)
* ATOM/RSS/JSON/Sitemap feeds now automatically use "ETag" HTTP headers which has potential speedup when fetching feeds with no new messages. This can bring 10-80 % speedup if user uses more feeds which do support "ETag". (#1136)
* Support for Sitemap "sitemap.xml" files is added! Vast majority of websites have sitemaps and RSS Guard now can read them in the same way it does with RSS/ATOM formats. "Discover feeds" dialog has Sitemaps support integrated and it even is able to traverse sitemap indexes. GZipped sitemaps are supported too. (#1129)
* Added multiple/extended selection to feeds list! Now it is possible to select multiple items at once (feeds, categories, etc.) and perform batch actions on them - batch editing, deleting, marking read/unread, re-sorting - when some feeds are selected it is now in "Edit selected items" dialog possible to batch change only some properties in a very clean and universal way. (#1010, #89)
* Localizations updated.
* Documentation updated.
* Arguments parsing is now totally overhauled. It is now possible to use both double and single quotes to quote arguments. Read "Scraping Websites" chapter in [docs](https://rssguard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/scraping.html#scraping-websites) to know more.
* Local files can now be used directly as sources for feeds, just select "Local file" in add/edit feed dialog.

Fixed:
* Fixed OPML import/export when some feeds use custom script as source. (#1133)
* RSS/ATOM parsing is now greatly enhanced.

4.5.1
-----

    * Can be displayed on secondary screens.
    * Automatically adopts look of currently active RSS Guard skin.
    * Can be close via close corner button or via `Esc` keyboard button.
    * When hovered with mouse, notification stays shown, when not hovered, it is automatically hidden after 15 seconds.
    * Displays list of newly fetched articles and offers some basic actions like marking as read, showing in article list or in web browser.
    * These notifications do not need "tray icon" to be activated.

* Many different features of RSS Guard got minor fixes, some parts of source code were refactored. Particularly, one nasty "semi-bug" was fixed which influenced speed of article switching in article list. It should now be faster. Much faster.
* Article counting for "regex queries" is now disabled because this was very performance-hungry even with small number of regex queries, sadly.
* Translations of some languages are now more complete.
* Some unused source code was removed.
* Some unused deps were removed.

4.5.0

* macOS build is now built with macOS 11.
* Linux build is now built with Ubuntu 20.04 which is now oldest supported Linux LTS distribution.
* Reworked logic of determining which article states (read/unread/starred/unstarred) have changed when synchronizing states to remote feed servers. This concerns all synchronized plugins like Gmail, Greader, Feedly, etc. and show in theory lead to much better performance when you mark many articles as read or unread.
* Couple of extra QoL enhancements for Gmail like proper encoding of attachment filenames, turned off displaying of "enclosures" as these are displayed in other way, etc.

Fixed:

* Minor enhancements for OPML importing.

Fixed:
* Showing pictures from authenticated feeds now should work. (#909)

4.3.2
-----

Added:
* Display total number of underlying feeds/categories in account's tooltip in feed list. (#881)

* Fixed TT-RSS icons downloading when obtaining list of feeds/folders.
* RSS Guard now converts all placeholders (for example "%data%") to native path folder separators.

4.3.0
-----

Added:
* Massive update for feed fetching mechanism. It is now very parallelized and performance gain should be brutal. On my development PC with 4 cores (Intel i5) I observed 800 % performance boost. Note that this feature required huge number of changes on source code so there could be some corner case regressions or not so polished situations. File bug report when that happens. Also, number of threads used by this feature is configurable via `--threads` command line switch. This parallelization approach will also be applied to some other parts of application in the future, particularly for some massive batched network operations in some plugin - TT-RSS, Greader or Gmail - which will result in massive performance boost too.
* RSS Guard is now available on Flathub in two distinct variants - "full" and "lite" (same as "nonwebengine").
* Suffix ".xml" is also accepted for OPML 2.0 files.
* Brutal speed enhancements when importing OPML 2.0 files. Whole functionality is now properly parallelized and performance boost is potentially massive, depending on number of your CPU cores/threads.
* Qt 6 bumped to 6.4.2 version - this fixes some regressions.

Fixed:
* Some random Mac OS X crash. (#866)

* AppImage reverted to Qt 5 as Qt 6 support in AppImage generator is very very buggy.
* All dialogs where icons/images are selected now load their "formats" dynamically to support all possible image formats correctly. (#834) This effectivelly adds "webp" and other formats on systems where it is supported.
* Fixed crash. (#849)
* Enable smooth-scrolling by default. (#793)

4.2.5
-----

-----

RSS Guard now has its own DISCORD: https://discord.gg/7xbVMPPNqH

-----

Added:
* Now it is possible to disable hardcoded keyboard shortcuts in feed/article lists so that user-defined single-stroke shortcuts can work properly. (#484)

Fixed:
* Settings dialog now remembers its size and also adds scrollbars where needed. Also was polished a bit. (#493)

* Fixed problem with linking "librssguard.so" on some Linux distributions. (#486)

4.0.0
-----

4.0.0 is new major release of RSS Guard. RSS Guard 4.x is NOT backwards compatible with 3.x line. Specifically:
* configuration file "config.ini" IS fully backwards compatible,
* database file "database.db" is NOT backwards compatible.

You may ask why is there new major version and why backwards compatibility is broken:
* I needed to completely overhaul some of core concepts inside RSS Guard.
* Database structure in file "database.db" was very complicated and hard to maintain and had to be simplified. Number of database tables was greatly reduced and whole structure is easier to follow.
* Source code was greatly simplified in many places which makes RSS Guard easier to maintain and easier to develop new features.
* Also, and this is potential killer feature, new changes allowed implementation of "next-gen" synchronization algorithms which may, in some cases, dramatically speed-up two-way synchronization of articles. This new synchronization algorithm is right now implemented and enabled for Google Reader API plugin as PoC and it is called "Intelligent synchronization algorithm" within RSS Guard. The algorithm will be implemented for other plugins over time.
* There is crazy number of new features and bugfixes. See list below.
* Also, let me say some more extra points:
    * More than 4 000 code changes were made in total during RSS Guard development. Codebase consists of 38 500 lines of C++ code.
    * First version of RSS Guard was published 8 years ago.
    * RSS Guard is one-man project, I have implemented it on my own. 99% of code is written from scratch.
    * Received donations for RSS Guard were under 100 USD in total.
    * If you feel that RSS Guard is slow, broken or shitty application, then you are probably right. Nonetheless, you should still submit well-structured and sane bug report, so that I can actually fix the issue! If you do not submit bug report, then please do no spread lies about how bad RSS Guard is and switch to another feed reader instead. 

Added:
* Brand new notifications subsystem added. It can play sounds, individual events are independently configurable in application settings. (#356, #144)
* "MessageObject" class now exposes "rawContents" property for message filtering. Property contains raw RSS/ATOM/JSON contents of the message. (#377)
* URL-embedded cookies are now supported, as well as classic cookies, which are now saved in non-persistent cookie jar. (#391)
* "Next-gen" synchronization algorithms which may, in some cases, dramatically speed-up two-way synchronization of articles. This new synchronization algorithm is right now implemented and enabled for Google Reader API plugin as PoC and is called "Intelligent synchronization algorithm" within RSS Guard. The algorithm will be also implemented for other plugins in the future.
* Google Reader API plugin supports "ot" option.
* Documentation was completely rewritten.
* Fixed support for OS/2.

* Inoreader plugin was merged into Google Reader API plugin as Inoreader too uses Google Reader API.
* Toolbar search boxes have now dynamic width. (#431)
* Visual state of some dialogs is now remembered, for example "Cleanup database".
* Some GUI texts and terms were unified and changed (message -> article, download feed -> fetch feed, etc.). (#430)
* There is now some default filename set when exporting feeds to file.
* Number of unread messages is now shown on Linux also in taskbar (not just tray icon). (#437)
* Unified minimize/maximize/close window buttons in all RSS Guard dialogs. (#439)
* Most of text boxes now have "clear text" button. (#438)
